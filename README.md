# Driving Test Simulator

Driving test simulator is an Unity based application, which is a morph of the NZTA Driving test and a application which shows and tells you how to drive your car.

This was created because when you are studying for the driving test(s), you're given a low resolution screenshot of a situation which some people find a struggle relating to what is happening with the real world with cause and affect.

This will then render a 2d world animation of what is occuring, and your choice will show you what would of happened if you chose that scenario.

This enables the test taker to see in real time their mistakes, and retrospectively learn instead of having a "Fail" and not understanding why their decision was the wrong one.

## Roadmap
Our Roadmap/current sprinting targets is outlined on Trello located here https://trello.com/b/KHdriV0i/2020s254drivingtestsimulator

## Current Issues
Scenes are not currently hooked to questions - This means the question animation is not functioning.
This is a key element that is missing that will be added in a future update.
