# Driving_Test_Simulator

This is an application that is based off the karting tutorial.

The plan for this is to incorperate elements of dodging incoming cars, missing various hazards on the road and answering questions that 
will directly relate to your driving tests within New Zealand.

This will either move you to a different scene and perform a parking challenge, or will keep you driving and having to identify and react
to hazards on the road and follow the signs.

Currently, the base elements of the game (Movement) has been configured, and the development team has ran into a issue where moving between
scenes doesn't save progress - This is to be fixed in a future update. 

Currently, the "CheckPoints" are visually shown, this will be changed to correctly be hidden and this is what triggers the question prompts in future.
